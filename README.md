# Welcome

Hi, my name is **Omar Said**. I am a Senior studying **Computer Science** and **Biomedical Engineering** at The University of Michigan. I am interested in research, especially in the field of **Computational Vascular Mechanics**. My future goal is to continue my research journey, enroll in a **PhD program**, and eventually work in academia as a professor.

Outside of school, I enjoy **playing soccer** and **scuba diving**. I am from Egypt, and these two hobbies of mine are very common amongst Egyptians.

### Philosophy Statement
I believe that real success comes from sticking to your core values, always growing, and genuinely wanting to make a positive difference in others’ lives. My approach to leadership is all about patience, persistence, resilience, creativity, and empathy.

Mentorship and education are super important to me. I love teaching and inspiring others, helping them find their potential and do meaningful work. Whether it’s developing new healthcare technologies or creating opportunities for underrepresented students in STEM, I want to leave a positive mark and make a lasting impact. I’m not afraid to take risks and step out of my comfort zone because that’s how I grow as a leader and handle challenges with confidence and flexibility.

In my perfect world, everyone has access to advanced healthcare and quality education. To make this happen, I’m committed to using my creativity and strategic thinking to solve tough problems that connect engineering and medicine. My goal is to build a better future by creating tools that improve patient care and support surgeons, while also pushing for educational fairness and mentoring the next generation of innovators.
