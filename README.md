### SMART Goals

1. I want to enroll in a PhD program in Bioengineering. I will research at least five potential PhD programs in Bioengineering by the end of this semester. I will achieve a competitive GPA, gain research experience through internships or projects, and obtain strong letters of recommendation to increase my chances of acceptance. Obtaining a PhD in Bioengineering aligns with my career aspirations to contribute to advancements in healthcare technology and biotechnology. I will submit my PhD program applications by November 1st of my senior year, allowing ample time for review and revisions before the application deadlines.
